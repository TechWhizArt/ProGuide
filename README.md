Some info about the website...
ProGuide is a website developed and managed by two second year students from Meerut Institute of Engineering and Technology, Meerut. Niharika and Aditi malik from Btech CSE(AIML) Department. 
In our freshers year, we had a lot of trouble starting coding and finding the right resources to start studying coding. We also had a hard time finding our interested topics and our specialisatio because of lack of knowledge and guideline. 
This website provides all the information a fresher need to know before starting coding and helps them to find their domain by providing them the informatiton of almost all the common starting languages at one place. It also provides them free youtube corses and books and website tutorials for free for them to study right away. The resources present in this website are recommended by the seniours of MIET Meerut that are specialists in that particular language. 
It also contain a editional feature called projects section in which all the projects of seniors will be added with their code repositories and developer profile for the freshers to learn from their senior's journey and improvements with due time.
Freshers can also add projects to this website to show as an example for other students.
Neither me nor Aditi has a specialisation in web development but we tried our best to make this website as a gift for our juniors and will be really happy and proud to know if even one of the student benefits from this website of ours. 
If you like our website, do write us a response and if you find any error in the information or think something can be improved, do not forget to tell us in detail as we will be utterly happy to know your interest in our website, and will start working on that topic right away.
We are trying our best to manage this website so please show some support and do send your projects to help other students with us too.
Thank you, yours Niharika(TechWhizArt) & Aditi.
